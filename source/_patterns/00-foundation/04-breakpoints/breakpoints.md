This is a grid showing the defined [Breakpoints](https://github.com/at-import/breakpoint/wiki) superimposed against the sizes of many common device widths. 

Any breakpoint variables defined in `source/_patterns/00-base/04-breakpoints/_breakpoints.scss` that start with `$bp--` the will vbe automatically pulled into this grid.
